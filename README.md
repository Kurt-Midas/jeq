# JEQ 
JEQ is an import/export market analysis app for Eve Online. Try pronouncing it and you'll figure it out. 

##Seriously?
No. It stands for Jita EQuivalent. It's intended to figure out the "Jita Equivalent" price of any good given transportation costs and stuff. In other words, this shows the break-even point to buy/sell at in another market in order to earn 0 profit. From there it should be simple enough to figure out what buy and sell orders to place on both ends.

V1 uses a static itemId list and only works with Vale and Jita. If you care enough, it should be easy to modify to whatever IDs you want. If you don't, you don't care. I'll add features as I find them useful -- maybe I'll finally integrate the reprocessing thing I've been working on since gadgets-scala. 

##No, but seriously
This is also to test integration with my go-crest library. I'm also going to mess with vue.js and html/template a bit more. I'll test it in-game but don't actually care. 

###Couldn't this have been done easier with a spreadsheet?
